# D191-AUTOMATING-DATA-INTEGRATION
PostgresSQL project for WGU. 

This project involves creating a real-world business report using attached data sets and dictionaries. It includes identifying specific tables and fields needed for the report, creating SQL code for table creation and data extraction, developing custom transformations, creating a trigger for updating the summary table, and creating a stored procedure to refresh the data. The project also requires providing a Panopto video demonstration, recording web sources, acknowledging sources, and demonstrating professional communication. The ultimate goal is to develop an efficient system for data analysis and reporting that helps stakeholders make informed business decisions.
